# Burak Kahraman Cloud Project

This repository was created for the Modern Cloud Computing course.

The purpose of this project is to set up a source code repository, become familiar with GitHub and Visual Studio Code, and track progress throughout the course using version control.

All assignments and project-related work for this course will be maintained and updated in this repository.
